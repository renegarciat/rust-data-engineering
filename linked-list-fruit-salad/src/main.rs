/*
As with the VecDeque example, this code starts by creating a LinkedList of fruits,
converts it to a Vec for shuffling, and then converts it back to a LinkedList.
After the shuffling, it adds "Pomegranate", "Fig", and "Cherry" to the end of the list.
Finally, it prints out the final fruit salad.

This example shows how to use a LinkedList, but remember that LinkedList
has a higher memory overhead and worse cache locality than Vec or VecDeque,
so it's typically not the best choice unless you have a specific need for the properties
of a linked list. In Rust, it's usually better to use a Vec or VecDeque.

A LinkedList is a doubly-linked list, which means that each element in the list
has a pointer to the next element and the previous element.
A great example of when to use a LinkedList is when you need to insert or remove elements
from the middle of the list.
